# Nightscout Counter
This plugin adds a Counters+ counter to show your blood sugar in Beat Saber.

If you're not diabetic, you're probably not going to use this. 
If you are diabetic and you're not sure what nightscout is, [check out this site](http://www.nightscout.info/) (I *highly* recommend setting up nightscout to any diabetic.)
# Installation
Download the latest release from the [releases tab](https://github.com/legoandmars/NightscoutCounter/releases/latest). 

Make sure that you have Counters+ installed. If you don't have it, you can download it from the [Counters Plus GitHub repo](https://github.com/Caeden117/CountersPlus/releases/latest).

Go to the `Mods` tab and click Counters+. Next, click `Counters` and then scroll all the way to the right. 

There should be a Nightscout counter - enable it, put in your Nightscout Site URL, and tweak the settings to your liking.
